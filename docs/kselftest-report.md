# LKFT kselftest Report Bits and Pieces

LKFT sends a daily report ([here's an
example](https://lists.linaro.org/pipermail/linux-kselftest-mirror/2019-April/004457.html))
to the kselftest mailing list that contains the results of kselftest on the
daily -next build.

This report is generated by [qa-reports](https://qa-reports.linaro.org), but
not sent from qa-reports. Rather, it uses a jenkins job and some custom
scripting. The implementation of this report uses the following files and jobs.

## Notification Jobs

The trigger job runs every hour and looks for new builds in qa-reports that
have not yet been reported.
- [Trigger LKFT Notify kselftest on -next](https://ci.linaro.org/job/trigger-lkft-notify-kselftest-next/)
  - [source](https://git.linaro.org/ci/job/configs.git/tree/trigger-lkft-notify-kselftest-next.yaml)
- [Notify LKFT kselftest on -next](https://ci.linaro.org/job/lkft-notify-kselftest-next/)
  - [source](https://git.linaro.org/ci/job/configs.git/tree/lkft-notify-kselftest-next.yaml)

## Notification Scripts

The jenkins jobs check out the following scripts from lkft-tools
- [trigger script](../bin/trigger_generate_next_kselftest_report.py)
- [report script](../bin/generate_next_kselftest_report.py)

Note also that there is a custom jinja2 template in qa-reports that is used to
filter out the kselftest data from the rest of the data.
